QUESTION:

 Suppose you have a sorted list of student exam scores. Explain how Binary Search can be
 applied to identify the position of a particular score in the list. Discuss any assumptions
 or requirements for using Binary Search in this scenario.

SOLUTION:

Binary Search can be applied to identify the position of a particular score in a sorted list of
student exam scores by repeatedly dividing the list in half and comparing the middle element
with the target score.

The process begins by comparing the target score with the middle element of the list. If the
target score is less than the middle element, then the search continues in the lower half of
the list. If the target score is greater than the middle element, then the search continues
 in the upper half of the list. This process is repeated until the target score is found, or
  until there are no more elements to search.

The assumptions and requirements for using Binary Search in this scenario include:
1. The list of student exam scores must be sorted in ascending or descending order.
2. The list must be accessible for random access, such as an array or a data structure that
supports efficient indexing.
3. The target score must be comparable to the elements in the list, i.e., it must be of the
same data type and follow the same ordering as the elements in the list.
4. The list should not be constantly changing, as Binary Search is not suitable for dynamic
 or frequently updated lists.
