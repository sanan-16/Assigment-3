QUESTION:

In a task scheduling application, describe how a hash table can be used to store and quickly
retrieve scheduled tasks based on their unique identifiers or names. Discuss the advantages
of using a hash table for task management.

SOLUTION:

In a task scheduling application, a hash table can be used to store and quickly retrieve scheduled tasks based on their unique identifiers or names. Each task can be assigned a unique identifier or name, which can then be used as the key in the hash
 table. The value associated with each key would be the details of the scheduled task, such as
 the time, date, and any other relevant information.

When a user wants to retrieve a specific task, they can simply provide the unique identifier or
name, and the hash table will quickly locate the corresponding value, allowing the user to access
 the details of the task.

The advantages of using a hash table for task management include:
1. Fast retrieval: Hash tables have constant time complexity for retrieval, meaning that the time
 it takes to retrieve a task does not depend on the number of tasks in the table. This makes it
 efficient for quickly accessing scheduled tasks.
2. Efficient storage: Hash tables use a key-value pair system, which allows for efficient storage
 and retrieval of tasks based on their unique identifiers or names.
3. Easy updates: Hash tables allow for easy insertion, deletion, and updating of tasks, making it
 simple to manage the task schedule.
4. Collision handling: Hash tables are designed to handle collisions, ensuring that tasks with
the same hash value can be stored and retrieved without issue.

Overall, using a hash table for task management provides a fast and efficient way to store and
 retrieve scheduled tasks based on their unique identifiers or names. It simplifies the task
 scheduling process and allows for quick access to task details.
