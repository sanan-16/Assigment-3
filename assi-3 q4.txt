QUESTION:

In a scientific experiment, data points are collected and sorted based on a parameter. Explain
how Binary Search could be applied to locate specific data points efficiently. Discuss the
scalability of Binary Search for large datasets.

SOLUTION:

Binary Search could be applied in a scientific experiment to efficiently locate specific data
points that have been sorted based on a parameter. This algorithm works by repeatedly dividing
in half the portion of the data that could contain the target value, and then comparing the
target value to the middle element of the resulting portion. This process continues until the
target value is found or the search space is empty.

In terms of scalability for large datasets, Binary Search is efficient because it has a time
complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of data points. This means that as the size of
the dataset increases, the time it takes to locate a specific data point using Binary Search
grows at a much slower rate compared to linear search algorithms. Therefore, Binary Search
is well-suited for large datasets and can efficiently locate specific data points even as
the dataset size increases.
